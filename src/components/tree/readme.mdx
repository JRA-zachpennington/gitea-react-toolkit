# Tree Components

There are three components that work together to render a Git Tree.

1. The [Tree Component](/tree#tree-component) is the higher order component that brings it all together, and renders a Tree Object Component.
2. The [TreeObject Component](/tree#treeobject-component) is a recursive component that renders a tree object and renders a Blob Object Component for each child Blob.
3. The [BlobObject Component](/tree#blobobject-component) is a component that renders a blob object.

## Tree Component

The Tree component accepts a tree (an array of tree objects),
or a url to fetch a tree from.

### Example 1

A manually provided tree listing.

<Playground>
<Paper>
  <Tree
    selected
    tree={[
      {
        "path": ".github",
        "type": "tree",
        "tree": [
          {
            "path": "config",
            "type": "blob",
          },
        ]
      },
      {
        "path": "LICENSE.md",
        "type": "blob",
      }
    ]}
  />
</Paper>
</Playground>

### Example 2

An automated tree listing from a Git Tree API url. Click on the tree objects to see them populate!

<Playground>
<Paper>
  <Tree
    selected
    url="https://api.github.com/repos/unfoldingword-box3/git-file-explorer/git/trees/748bc59ef4d5ac9bbacbe6f3d3f3604775540fee"
  />
</Paper>
</Playground>

<Props of={Tree} />


### Sample Data
```json
[
  {
    "path": ".github",
    "type": "tree",
    ...
  },
  {
    "path": "LICENSE.md",
    "type": "blob",
    ...
  }
]
```


## TreeObject Component

The TreeObject Component is a recursive component that renders more trees
when it encouters an object in the tree of type tree.

### Example

<Playground>
<Paper>
  <TreeObject
    path=""
    type="tree"
    selected
    pathSelected="LICENSE.md"
    tree={[
      {
        "path": ".github",
        "type": "tree"
      },
      {
        "path": "content",
        "type": "tree"
      },
      {
        "path": "LICENSE.md",
        "type": "blob"
      },
      {
        "path": "README.md",
        "type": "tree"
      },
    ]}
  />
</Paper>
</Playground>

<Props of={TreeObject} />

### Sample Data
```json
{
  "path": ".github",
  "type": "tree",
  ...
}
```


## BlobObject Component

### Example
Here are a few variations of the File component being rendered.
Even though it appears to be a nested tree, it is simulated.
You would typically use another component to render more than one.

<Playground>
  <Paper style={{margin: '1em 0'}}>
    <BlobObject path="LICENSE.md" depth={1} />
  </Paper>
  <Paper style={{margin: '1em 0'}}>
    <BlobObject path="readme.md" depth={2} />
  </Paper>
  <Paper style={{margin: '1em 0'}}>
    <BlobObject path="01.md" depth={3} />
  </Paper>
  <Paper style={{margin: '1em 0'}}>
    <BlobObject path="title.md" depth={3} selected />
  </Paper>
</Playground>

<Props of={BlobObject} />

### Sample Data
```json
{
  "path": "LICENSE.md",
  "type": "blob",
  ...
}
```
