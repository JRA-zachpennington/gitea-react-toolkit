# BlobObject Component

## Example
Here are a few variations of the File component being rendered.
Even though it appears to be a nested tree, it is simulated.
You would typically use another component to render more than one.

<Playground>
<Paper style={{margin: '1em 0'}}>
  <BlobObject path="LICENSE.md" depth={1} />
</Paper>
<Paper style={{margin: '1em 0'}}>
  <BlobObject path="readme.md" depth={2} />
</Paper>
<Paper style={{margin: '1em 0'}}>
  <BlobObject path="01.md" depth={3} />
</Paper>
<Paper style={{margin: '1em 0'}}>
  <BlobObject path="title.md" depth={3} selected />
</Paper>
</Playground>

## Properties
<Props of={BlobObject} />

## Sample Data
```json
{
  "path": "LICENSE.md",
  "type": "blob",
  ...
}
```
